## Works with Ansible Galaxy

You can install this role with the `ansible-galaxy` command, and can run it
directly from the git repository.

You should install it like this:

```
ansible-galaxy install couchbaselabs.couchbase_server
```

Make sure you have write access to `/etc/ansible/roles/` since
that is the default Ansible role installation path, or define your own
Ansible role path by creating a `$HOME/.ansible.cfg` file with these contents:

```
[defaults]
roles_path = <path_to_your_preferred_role_location>
```

Change `<path_to_your_preferred_role_location>` to a directory you have write
access to.

See the [ansible-galaxy](http://docs.ansible.com/galaxy.html) documentation
for more details.

## Role Variables

In cases where you want simple clusters for development or other
non-production use, the values for Couchbase Server role's default variables
are good as-is.  The only required variable is the [`couchbase_nodes:`](#couchbase_nodes)

Should you need specific performance or otherwise wish to tweak them
for your particular purpose, this section describes all the role variables
for your reference in detail, including their default values.

### couchbase_server_edition

The version of Couchbase Server, this can be `enterprise` or `community`.  The default value is `enterprise`

### couchbase_server_version

The version and build that you want to install, by default the value is `latest`.  If you want to use a specific version, you would would specify `6.6.0-7909`.  To find the available versions run the command:

```bash
yum list --showduplicates couchbase-server
```
### couchbase_server_download_url

A fully qualified URL to an `*.rpm` or `*.deb` file that you wish to install Couchbase Server from.

| log\_rotate\_size  | 20971520  | Specifies the audit log rotate size. This is the size at which the current audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk space. The minimum audit log rotate size is 0 bytes and maximum is 524,288,000 (500MB). When it is set to 0 the log will not be rotated based on size.  |

### couchbase_buckets[]

The `couchbase_buckets` variable is an empty list by default.  When specified the following properties are available to each item in the list, the `name` property is required, all other properties are optional and will be assigned to the default value listed if not specified.  [Additional Documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/cli/cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-create.html)

| **Variable** | **Default** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| \*name  |  *null* | The name of the bucket to create. The only characters that can be used for the bucket-name are those in the ranges of A-Z, a-z, and 0-9; plus the underscore, period, dash, and percent characters. The name can be a maximum of 100 characters in length.  |
| type  | couchbase  | The type of bucket to create. Accepted bucket types are "couchbase", "ephemeral", and "memcached". The Couchbase bucket is the standard bucket type. It supports data persistence, replication, caching, indexing, views, and N1QL queries. The Ephemeral bucket is an in-memory bucket similar to the Couchbase bucket; but it does not support data persistence or views.   The Memcached bucket is a cache-only bucket that does not support persistence, replication, indexing, views, or N1QL querying: this bucket type provides the same behavior as Memcached Server. Memcached buckets are deprecated and Ephemeral buckets should be used instead.  |
| storage_backend | couchstore | The type of storage to use with the bucket. This is only specified for "couchbase" buckets. Accepted values are "couchstore" or "magma". |
| ram_size  | 100  | The amount of memory to allocate to the cache for this bucket, in Megabytes. The memory quota of this bucket must fit into the overall cluster memory quota. The minimum cache size is 100MB.  |
| replicas  | 1  |  The number of servers to which data is replicated. Replicas provide protection against data loss by keeping copies of this bucket’s data on multiple servers. By default, the number of replicas is one, even if there is only a single server in the cluster. The minimum number of replicas is zero, and the maximum three. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only.  |
|  priority | low  | Specifies the priority of this bucket’s background tasks. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only. For Couchbase buckets, background task-types include disk I/O, DCP stream-processing, and item-paging. For Ephemeral buckets, background task-types are the same as for Couchbase buckets, with the exception of disk I/O, which does not apply to Ephemeral buckets. The value of this option may be "high" or "low". The default is "low". Specifying "high" may result in faster processing; but only when more than one bucket is defined for the cluster, and when different priority settings have been established among the buckets. When Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets have different priority settings, this affects the prioritization only of task-types other than disk I/O.  |
| eviction_policy  |  valueOnly | The memory-cache eviction policy for this bucket. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only.<br><br>Couchbase buckets support either "valueOnly" or "fullEviction". Specifying the "valueOnly" policy means that each key stored in this bucket must be kept in memory. This is the default policy: using this policy improves performance of key-value operations, but limits the maximum size of the bucket. Specifying the "fullEviction" policy means that performance is impacted for key-value operations, but the maximum size of the bucket is unbounded.<br><br>Ephemeral buckets support either "noEviction" or "nruEviction". Specifying "noEviction" means that the bucket will not evict items from the cache if the cache is full: this type of eviction policy should be used for in-memory database use-cases. Specifying "nruEviction" means that items not recently used will be evicted from memory, when all memory in the bucket is used: this type of eviction policy should be used for caching use-cases.  |
|  conflict_resolution | sequence  | Specifies this bucket’s conflict resolution mechanism; which is to be used if a conflict occurs during Cross Data-Center Replication (XDCR). Sequence-based and timestamp-based mechanisms are supported.<br><br>Sequence-based conflict resolution selects the document that has been updated the greatest number of times since the last sync: for example, if one cluster has updated a document twice since the last sync, and the other cluster has updated the document three times, the document updated three times is selected; regardless of the specific times at which updates took place.<br><br>Timestamp-based conflict resolution selects the document with the most recent timestamp: this is only supported when all clocks on all cluster-nodes have been fully synchronized.  |
| flush  | false  | Specifies whether or not the flush operation is allowed for this bucket.   |
| durability\_min\_level  |  none | The minimum durability level for the bucket. Accepted values for "ephemeral" buckets are "none" or "majority". Accepted values for "couchbase" buckets are "none", "majority", "majorityAndPersistActive", or "persistToMajority".<br><br>"none" specifies mutations to the bucket are asynchronous and offer no durability guarantees. "majority" specifies mutations must be replicated to (that is, held in the memory allocated to the bucket on) a majority of the Data Service nodes. "majorityAndPersistActive" specifies mutations must be replicated to a majority of the Data Service nodes. Additionally, it must be written to disk on the node hosting the active vBucket for the data. "persistToMajority" specifies mutations must be persisted to a majority of the Data Service nodes. Accordingly, it will be written to disk on those nodes.  |
|  compression_mode | passive  | Specifies the compression-mode of the bucket. There are three options; off, passive and active. All three modes are backwards compatible with older SDKs, where Couchbase Server will automatically uncompress documents for clients that do not understand the compression being used. This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.<br><br>Off: Couchbase Server will only compress document values when persisting to disk. This is suitable for use cases where compression could have a negative impact on performance. Please note it is expected that compression in most use cases will improve performance.<br><br>Passive: Documents which were compressed by a client, or read compressed from disk will be stored compress in-memory. Couchbase Server will make no additional attempt to compress documents that are not already compressed.<br><br>Active: Couchbase Server will actively and aggressively attempt to compress documents, even if they have not been received in a compressed format. This provides the benefits of compression even when the SDK clients are not complicit.  |
|  max_ttl | 0  | Specifies the maximum TTL (time-to-live) for all documents in bucket in seconds. If enabled and a document is mutated with no TTL or a TTL greater than than the maximum, its TTL will be set to the maximum TTL. Setting this option to 0 disables the use of max-TTL and the largest TTL that is allowed is 2147483647. This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.  |
|  enable\_index\_replica | false  | Enables view index replication for the current bucket. This option is valid for Couchbase buckets only.  |

```yaml
couchbase_buckets:
  - name: baseball
    type: couchbase
